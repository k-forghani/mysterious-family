# Mysterious Family

## Introduction

This is a simple secure implementation of family tree, developed as the final project of **Data Structures and Algorithms** (**Fall 2023**) course at **Iran University of Science and Technology**. The architecture of the project is based on the [project description](schema/description.pdf) provided by teaching assistants.

## Prerequisites

On Ubuntu operating system, install these prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt install libboost-dev
sudo apt install crow-v1.0+h.deb
```

## Compilation

On Unix-like operating systems, to compile the project and run the interface, just run `run.sh` with `app` argument:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh app
```

Instead of using the interface, you may run the test to debug the project:
